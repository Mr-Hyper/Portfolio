# BB POS - Point Of Sale System

[Project Report](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17706909/A2.Project.Report.pdf)

- Using **C#** and the **Unity Engine**, my team and I are iterating on our previous project and experimenting with 3D. 
- Compared to the previous project, I am **operating this one at very minimal to no cost – no money has been spent on developing game prototypes**.
- **Tested 5 prototypes with focus groups** to validate game features, which has **made us pivot the initial game concept 2 times** thus far.

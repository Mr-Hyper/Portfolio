# Cyber - Mobile Game
- Using **C#** and the **Unity Engine**, I created a mobile game that was trying to bring the best aspects of the looter-shooter genre over to the mobile platforms. 
- **Led a team of freelancers** during various stages of development, coordinating between game design, art and programming. 
- **Released prototype in April 2023, iterated and launched demo in April 2024**. **Organically grew to 100+ downloads on each platform** soon after launch. Received mixed reviews.

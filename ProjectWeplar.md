# Project Weplar - Mobile Game
- Using **C#** and the **Unity Engine**, my team and I are building a **multiplayer game** where you play as a mage that can engage in **turn-based combat** to have magic battles with other players. 
- Compared to my previous project, I am **operating this one at very minimal to no cost â€“ no money has been spent on developing game prototypes**. 
- **Tested 5 prototypes with focus groups** to validate game features, which has **made us pivot the initial game concept 2 times** thus far.
